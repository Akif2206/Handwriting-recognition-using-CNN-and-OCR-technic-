Handwriting Recognition System
Project Description
This project implements a handwriting recognition system that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to process handwritten text images and convert them into a digital format. It supports recognition of characters, digits, and full sentences.

Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system before running the project:

Python: Version 3.7 or higher.
Tesseract OCR:
Install Tesseract OCR.
Ensure the tesseract executable is added to your system's PATH.
For Windows, download from Tesseract OCR.
Git (optional, for cloning the repository).
Dependencies
Install the following Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras pytesseract opencv-python scikit-learn
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/handwriting-recognition-system.git
cd handwriting-recognition-system
Install Tesseract OCR: Follow the official instructions.

Configure Tesseract in Python: Locate the Tesseract executable. For example:

Windows: "C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"
Linux/Mac: /usr/local/bin/tesseract
Update the tesseract_cmd path in the code:

python
Copy code
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'path_to_tesseract_executable'
Prepare Dataset:

Use a dataset containing images of handwritten text.
Ensure the images are in a folder named data/images.
Run the Application: Execute the main script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Features
Preprocessing techniques such as grayscale conversion, resizing, binarization, and noise removal.
Handwriting recognition using CNNs for accurate predictions.
Integration with Tesseract OCR for improved performance.
Spelling correction and formatted output.
Usage
Input:

Place handwritten text images in the input folder.
Supported formats: .png, .jpg, .jpeg.
Run Script:

Recognized text will be displayed in the console and saved as a .txt file in the output folder.
Modify Parameters:

Adjust preprocessing or CNN hyperparameters in the config.py file.
Output
Recognized text is saved in output/results.txt.
Logs and performance metrics are stored in logs/.
Troubleshooting
Ensure tesseract_cmd points to the correct path of the Tesseract executable.
For missing Python libraries, reinstall dependencies using:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
